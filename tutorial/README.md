# Intake Tutorial

This directory includes three notebooks to demonstrate Intake from the point of view of three personas:

* [data scientist](data_scientist.ipynb) - for the end-user who want to find, load and analyse their data
* [data engineer](data_engineer.ipynb) - for the curator of data and catalogues, who decides how best to
  store and expose data
* [developer](dev.ipynb) - for authors of new drivers and other extensions to Intake's capabilities. This
  person does not necessarily develop any code for the Intake package itself.
